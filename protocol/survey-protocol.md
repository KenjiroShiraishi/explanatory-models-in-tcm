# Survey Protocol Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the patient questionnaire designed for the "Applying Explanatory Models" project.

## Purpose

The aim of this protocol is twofold:

1. To explore whether patients who have experienced uncertainty or anxiety due to the absence of a biomedical diagnosis can gain a sense of reassurance when offered structured, TCM-based explanatory narratives (e.g., Liver Qi stagnation, Spleen Qi deficiency).
2. To introduce appropriate multidisciplinary referrals when needed, thereby facilitating integrated care and supporting clinical decision-making.

## Target Participants

- Person who have experienced distress or anxiety due to undiagnosed symptoms.
- Patients who received an explanatory narrative based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) frameworks during their clinical visit.

## Survey Method

- Format: Paper-based, handwritten questionnaire.
- Timing: Administered after the clinical session in which a TCM narrative explanation is provided.
- Estimated response time: 3-5 minutes.
- Anonymity: No personally identifying information is collected.

## Example Questions

- Do you agree that it is distressing when no clear diagnosis is provided?
- Did the TCM explanation help you better understand your symptoms?
- Did the explanation reduce your anxiety?

These questions are presented using a 5-point Likert scale and supplemented by optional open-ended comments.

## Ethical Notes

- Participation is voluntary and anonymous.
- Responses are used only for the purposes of this practice-based research project.
- Patients can decline to participate at any time without consequence.
