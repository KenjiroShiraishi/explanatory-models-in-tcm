# üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Notes for Participating Clinicians and Researchers

This project is part of an open science initiative and may lead to peer-reviewed publication.

If you participate in data collection, protocol refinement, or interpretation of results, you may be invited to become a co-author on future academic outputs.

All authorship decisions will follow international standards (e.g., [ICMJE guidelines](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/)), which require:

- Substantial contribution to the conception, design, data, or interpretation  
- Approval of the final draft  
- Accountability for the integrity of the work

If you cannot meet these standards, your contribution will still be acknowledged appropriately in the publication.
