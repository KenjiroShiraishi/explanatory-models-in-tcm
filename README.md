# Explanatory Models in Traditional Medicine

This repository supports the open research project **"Applying Explanatory Models: Using Traditional Medicine Narratives to Support Patients Without a Diagnosis"**, which explores how culturally rooted narratives based on traditional medicine frameworks can reduce patient anxiety and enhance meaning-centered care—especially in cases where biomedical diagnosis remains unclear.

## 📘 Project Overview

- Use traditional diagnostic frameworks (e.g., Liver Qi stagnation, Cold-Heat imbalance, meridian-based assessments) to offer culturally resonant explanations for symptoms.
- Promote patient agency through explanatory models, self-care strategies, and clearly structured care roadmaps.
- Implemented in acupuncture and traditional medicine clinical settings with real-world feedback collection.

## 🧪 Data and Tools

- Clinical protocol (under development)
- Patient and clinician surveys (Likert + open-ended)
- Thematic analysis scripts (forthcoming)
- Visual frameworks such as the **Three Domains Model** [here](https://github.com/KenjiroShiraishi/explanatory-models-in-tcm/blob/main/Three%20Domains%20Model.pdf)

## 🌱 Background Inspiration

The initial idea for this project was first shared in a public blog post written in Japanese:
👉 [Why We Need a Narrative When There's No Diagnosis (Blog post)](https://jikotiryousoudan.com/tanashi/blog/14802/)

This blog introduces the practical and emotional context in which patients often struggle with anxiety in the absence of a clear diagnosis. It outlines how traditional narrative frameworks—especially from East Asian medicine—can offer a structured and compassionate explanation that restores meaning.

The project documented here builds upon that real-world clinical insight.
