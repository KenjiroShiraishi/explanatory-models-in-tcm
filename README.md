# Explanatory Models in Traditional Medicine

This repository supports the open research project **"Applying Explanatory Models: Using Traditional Medicine Narratives to Support Patients Without a Diagnosis"**, which explores how culturally rooted narratives based on traditional medicine frameworks can reduce patient anxiety and enhance meaning-centered care—especially in cases where biomedical diagnosis remains unclear.

> 🔄 **Note**: While many examples draw from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this project is not limited to TCM alone. We aim to explore and incorporate explanatory models from a broad range of traditional medicine systems—including East Asian, Ayurvedic, Kampo, and other culturally embedded medical frameworks.

## 📘 Project Overview

- Use traditional diagnostic frameworks (e.g., Liver Qi stagnation, Cold-Heat imbalance, meridian-based assessments) to offer culturally resonant explanations for symptoms.  
- Promote patient agency through explanatory models, self-care strategies, and clearly structured care roadmaps.  
- Implemented in acupuncture and traditional medicine clinical settings with real-world feedback collection.

## 🧪 Data and Tools

- Clinical protocol (under development)  
- Patient and clinician surveys (Likert + open-ended)  
- Thematic analysis scripts (forthcoming)  
- Visual frameworks such as the *Three Domains Model*

## 🌱 Background Inspiration

The initial idea for this project was first shared in a public blog post written in Japanese:  
👉 [Why We Need a Narrative When There's No Diagnosis (Blog post)](https://jikotiryousoudan.com/tanashi/blog/14802/)

This blog introduces the practical and emotional context in which patients often struggle with anxiety in the absence of a clear diagnosis. It outlines how traditional narrative frameworks—especially from East Asian medicine—can offer a structured and compassionate explanation that restores meaning.

The project documented here builds upon that real-world clinical insight.
