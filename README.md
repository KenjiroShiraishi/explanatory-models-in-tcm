# Explanatory Models in TCM

This repository supports the open research project **"Embodying Explanatory Models: Integrating TCM for Meaningful Care"**, which explores how Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) frameworks can reduce patient anxiety and enhance meaning-centered care—especially in cases where biomedical diagnosis remains unclear.

## 📘 Project Overview

- Use TCM pattern diagnosis (e.g., Liver Qi stagnation, Spleen deficiency) to offer culturally resonant explanations for symptoms.
- Promote patient agency through explanatory models, self-care strategies, and clearly structured care roadmaps.
- Implemented in an acupuncture and TCM practice setting with real-world feedback collection.

## 🧪 Data and Tools

- Clinical protocol (under development)
- Patient and clinician surveys (Likert + open-ended)
- Thematic analysis scripts (forthcoming)
- Visual frameworks such as the **Three Domains Model**  [here](https://github.com/KenjiroShiraishi/explanatory-models-in-tcm/blob/main/Three%20Domains%20Model.pdf) .
